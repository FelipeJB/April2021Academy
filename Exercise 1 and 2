1. What is the difference between an Inheritance and Polymorphism?

The main difference between inheritance and Polymorphism is that the inheritance allows a class to use the attributes
and methods from an existing class (Super class or father class), while the polymorphism allows that an object has different
behaviours.

2. What is the difference between data Abstraction and Encapsulation?

In the encapsulation I define the access modifiers with the purpose to implement security to some attributes which only have access
through public methods while the abstraction allows me to hide the details of the implementation.
